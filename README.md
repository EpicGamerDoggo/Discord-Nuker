Tutorial:

Extract the file with WinRar or any program.

Configure your custom bot token and command triggers in config.json.

Start the program by opening the .bat file.

Default commands (customisable):

!nuke = Ban all members, delete all channels
!banall = Ban all members
!deleteall Delete all channels

Run the command in any channel which the bot can see in your target server.

Watch the destruction.
